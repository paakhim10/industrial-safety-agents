# Evaluation of Vision-Language Models for Industrial Safety Use Cases

## 1. Introduction

This report evaluates lightweight Vision-Language Models (VLMs) suitable for **real-time industrial safety applications**.  
The use cases involve **camera-based monitoring** where models must interpret visual scenes, answer safety-related questions, and provide contextual descriptions (captioning).

**Ideal VLMs should support:**

- Visual Question Answering (VQA)
- Image captioning
- Low-latency inference
- Adaptability via fine-tuning

---

## 2. Selection Criteria

The models were shortlisted and tested based on the following:

- **VQA Capability**: Ability to answer questions grounded in image context
- **Captioning Support**: Ability to generate contextual and relevant descriptions of scenes
- **Lightweight**: Model size under ~7B parameters for real-time feasibility
- **Fine-tunability**: Ease of adapting to domain-specific safety data
